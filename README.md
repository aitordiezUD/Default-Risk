# Default Risk Prediction Project


## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the default risk of individuals seeking loans, utilizing machine learning techniques. By employing various models and data preprocessing methods, the goal is to enhance financial inclusion for the underserved population, ensuring that creditworthy individuals have access to loans.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is sourced from a [Kaggle competition hosted by Home Credit Group](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview). It focuses on individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit histories, and includes alternative data such as telco and transactional information to assess repayment abilities. Home Credit aims to create a positive borrowing experience for this demographic, and this project seeks to unlock the potential of their data to better predict repayment capabilities.

## Objectives
* Conduct thorough data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
* Apply Machine Learning techniques to predict loan repayment abilities.
* Evaluate model performance and provide insights for improving lending practices.
